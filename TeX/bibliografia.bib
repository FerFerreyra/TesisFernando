abstract="A protogroup is an ordered monoid in which each element a has both a left proto-inverse aℓ such that aℓa ≤ 1 and a right proto-inverse ar such that aar ≤ 1. We explore the assignment of elements of a free protogroup to English words as an aid for checking which strings of words are well-formed sentences, though ultimately we may have to relax the requirement of freeness. By a pregroup we mean a protogroup which also satisfies 1 ≤ aaℓ and 1 ≤ ara, rendering aℓ a left adjoint and ar a right adjoint of a. A pregroup is precisely a poset model of classical non-commutative linear logic in which the tensor product coincides with it dual. This last condition is crucial to our treatment of passives and Wh-questions, which exploits the fact that aℓℓ ≠ a in general. Free pregroups may be used to recognize the same sentences as free protogroups.",
